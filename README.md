Yet Another Majora's Mask Pictographic Randomizer Tracker

Most of this was forked from exodus122 (https://github.com/exodus122/mm-tracker), which is an excellent tracker that you should probably use instead of this one. This fork exists solely so I can experiment with customizing the layout. Exodus' tracker was in turn based on Soli's OoT tracker (https://github.com/soilflux/tracker). Check both those guys out they're way smarter than me.
